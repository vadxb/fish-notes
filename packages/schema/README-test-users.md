# Test Users Seed Data

## Overview

This document describes the test users and data created by the `seedTestUsers.ts` script.

## Test Users

- **50 test users** created with pattern: `dev3@email.com` to `dev52@email.com`
- **Names**: `User3` to `User52` (stored in `name` field)
- **Usernames**: `User3` to `User52` (stored in `username` field)
- **Passwords**: `12345678` (hashed with bcrypt, salt rounds: 10)
- **Subscription**: All users are `premium`
- **Country**: All users are assigned to `Belarus`
- **IDs**: Auto-generated by Prisma (cuid format)

## Data Created Per User

Each test user has:

- **2-3 spots** (fishing locations)
- **2-3 events** (fishing trips)
- **2-3 catches** (fish caught, all shared publicly)

## Total Data Created

- **50 users** (dev3@email.com to dev52@email.com)
- **129 spots** (fishing locations with coordinates)
- **125 events** (fishing trips with start/end times)
- **120 catches** (fish caught with photos, all shared)
- **680 likes** (3-8 likes per shared catch)
- **451 comments** (2-5 comments per shared catch)

## Data Relationships

- Each catch is linked to an event and optionally a spot
- All catches are shared publicly (`isShared: true`)
- Likes and comments are from random users (not the catch owner)
- All data uses Belarus fish species, baits, and water bodies

## Image Storage

- **Catch Images**: Each catch has 1-3 unique images
- **Image Source**: Real fish and fishing images from Unsplash
- **Content**: Fish, fishing equipment, and nature scenes (no people)
- **Format**: Direct URLs to high-quality images
- **Variety**: 30+ curated fishing-related images
- **No Local Storage**: Images are served directly from Unsplash

## Usage

You can now log in as any test user (e.g., `dev5@email.com` / `12345678`) to see:

- Their personal spots, events, and catches
- Shared catches from other users with likes and comments
- Full premium features
